The point of this n8n workflow and python script combination is to help pentesters keep track of their notes as well
as provide insight for beginning penetration testers who get stuck. I used a telegram bot to recieve the output but you can output the summary/notes to a google doc, word doc (license permitting). 

Prerequistes:
  1. Access to n8n (wether you self host or buy a cloud instance)
  2. Api key from an LLM of you choice: I used gemini-flash 2.0 due to it being free
  3. A txt file without output from a command 



CLI Example:
#pentesting tool command
$ sudo nmap -sV <target ip> -oN <output file>.txt

#push output to n8n workflow
$ python3 call_to_n8n.py -f <output file>.txt -u <your n8n ip>:5678 ##use the URL from the production tab in your webhook node
