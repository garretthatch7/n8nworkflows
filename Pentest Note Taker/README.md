The point of this n8n workflow and python script combination is to help pentesters keep track of their notes as well
as provide insight for beginning penetration testers who get stuck

Prerequistes:
  Access to n8n (where you self host or buy a cloud instance)
  Api key from an LLM of you choice: I used gemini-flash 2.0 due to it being free
  A txt file with output from a command 



CLI Example:
#pentesting tool command
$ sudo nmap -sV <target ip> -oN <output file>.txt

#push output to n8n workflow
$ python3 call_to_n8n.py -f <output file>.txt -u <your n8n ip>:5678 ##use the URL from the production tab in your webhook node
